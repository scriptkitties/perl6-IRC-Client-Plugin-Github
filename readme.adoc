= IRC::Client::Plugin::Github
:toc: preamble

A plugin for Github functionality in IRC::Client projects.

== Features
This module is currently only handling Github notifications through the webhook
system.

=== Notifications through Github webhooks
Using https://github.com/Bailador/Bailador[Bailador] as webserver, the plugin
can act upon Github webhook calls. This means immediate notifications whenever
something happens on a configured repository.

== Usage

Install the module through https://github.com/ugexe/zef[zef]:

----
zef install IRC::Client::Plugin::Github
----

Sample setup for an `IRC::Client` project using `IRC::Client::Plugin::Github`:

[source,perl6]
----
use Config;
use IRC::Client;
use IRC::Client::Plugin::Github;

sub MAIN
{
	my Config $config = Config.new;

	.run with IRC::Client.new(
		:nick<shithub>,
		:plugins(
			IRC::Client::Plugin::Github.new(config => $config)
		)
	);
}
----

=== Configuration
Configuration is done using https://github.com/scriptkitties/p6-Config[Config].

My preferred way of configuration is with `toml` files, so that's what I'll use
here to layout the configuration options. If you want to use another style,
adapt as necesary and make sure there's a parser available and installed to use
with `Config`.

[source,toml]
----
# Set this to true to get more output on reasons why things might not be
# working for you.
debug = false

# General configuration of the plugin
[github.webhook]

# Which IP to bind Bailador to.
host = "0.0.0.0"

# Which port to bind Bailador to.
port = 8000

# Set the message-style to "notice" to send notices instead of PRIVMSGs
message-style = "privmsg"

# The default channels to send to. If no channels are configured on the
# repository's configuration key, this array will be used instead.
channels = ["#scriptkitties"]

# A secret shared between the bot and the Github webhook. If set, HMAC
# verification will be employed. Messages failing this verification will be
# dropped.
secret = ""

# If set to true, it will notify for every repository that POSTs a payload to
# the Bailador instance. Note this could be abused to spam through the bot.
# When false, every repository should be properly defined if you want to see
# any notifications from it.
allow-unknown = false

# Every repository must be configured with a heading similar like this,
# "github.webhook.repos.<repo-name>", where the repo name is the `full-name`
# attribute on the `repository` key from the webhook payload. Every "/" in the
# `full-name` must be converted to a "-", in order to play nice with toml.
[github.webhook.repos.scripkitties-perl6-IRC-Client-Plugin-Github]

# An array of channels to post notifications in. Overrides the
# `default-channels` from `github.webhook` if set.
channels = ["#scriptkitties"]
